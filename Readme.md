## Genetic Algorithm.

Guessing numbers with our typical python code is no longer fun.<br>
How about we use *genetic algorithm* to guess?
and why numbers? let's use strings instead.

In this project, I am developing a genetic algorithm to guess a given string.

## Technologies used.

[![Python](https://github.com/jalbertsr/logo-badge-images/blob/master/img/rsz_python.png?raw=true)](https://www.python.org/)

## Further improvements.
- Include numbers and more punctuations.
- Deploying **it on Flask.**

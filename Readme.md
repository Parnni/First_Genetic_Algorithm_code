# Genetic Algorithm.

Guessing numbers with our typical python code is no longer fun.<br>
How about we use *genetic algorithm* to guess?
and why numbers? let's use strings instead.

In this project, I am developing a genetic algorithm to guess the given string.

# Results.

## Further improvements.
- Include numbers and more punctuations.
- Include **unit tests.**
- Deploying **it on Flask.**
